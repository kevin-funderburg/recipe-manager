# My Cookbook

We are proposing an application to manage various recipes, in order to consolidate and organize them for quick and convenient access.​

If a user creates or has found a recipe they want to save, they could simply enter some of the basic information about the recipe, and the app will save it to a database. Or if the user would like to import a recipe from a website, they can enter the URL and it will be added in the proper format.​

All saved recipes would be available to query and reference at any time. The app will also give recipe suggestions based on what ingredients are on hand.​
